        <p>Chat-GPT is limited by the information that it is trained on. Models like GPT-3.5 are only trained on data until 2021, now missing 2 years of new information. Chrome-GPT tries to break this barrier through prompt engineering and context injection.</p>
        <p>The extension works by transforming all paragraphs on a webpage into vector embeddings and then calculating vector cosine similarity with your prompt, to inject the most relevant information.</p>
        <p>Currently awaiting approval to post the extension on the Chrome web-store.</p>
        <p>Made in collaboration with Matthew Leung and powered by OpenAI API.</p>
